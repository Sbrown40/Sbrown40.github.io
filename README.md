My github account was created for student access. I would assume coding and other such aspects will take place in the work environment.
In the repository created; it is a simple document with only the github .io username. Sbrown40.github.io. It does provide a clear layout to the informmation needed.
Steps taken to clone the repository to my local drive were to first create the file by clicking the plus sign and then New Repository. Once the repository was created it needed a name, this resulted in giving the repository the github.io tag. Upon completing thos steps, I clicked create at the bottom right screen. After this was completed the read me file was saved. I then cloned the desktop and saved the file in the local C drive.
